! Instruction file for pcom
!
! pcom uses this file to accomplish two configuration changes:
!
! 1. endian status big/little.
! 2. mpb (machine parameter block).
!
! These are done by setting different module paths for this file. Thus each 
! configuration is stored in a different directory, but with the same filename.
! Thus the path selects the correct file.
