******************************* NEWS FOR 2023-02-06 ****************************

Welcome to the 0.1 release!

This is the first (beta) release of Pascal-P6. Although Pascal-P6 is still very
much in development, I get complaints about there not being a release. This is
a legitimate complaint, and I have made it about other projects.

The occasion for the release is that a significant portion of the Pascaline
language standard has been implemented, and a regression test exists for that.
In addition, I have run many tests on the project, and the stability has been
greatly improved.

The language guide is pascaline.docx as usual. And as usual, I assume you have
resources for the ISO 7185 Pascal language.

What follows is a list of unimplemented features, and this superceeds the 
documentation. It is mostly a list of points from pascaline_tests/pascaline.pas,
the acceptance test for Pascaline. It may be (and probably is) incomplete.

There is a lot that works here in Pascaline! And of course the entire ISO 7185
language is here. The biggest lack is the set of outcalls or system calls, which
I haven't had time to connect to Pascal-P6, outside of the services module.

Pascaline features not implemented in Pascal-P6 0.1:

* 6.16 Constant strings on read/ln is not implemented (specifying text to skip).

* 6.16.1 Radix convertion on input.

* 6.16.2 Radix specifiers in read/ln statements.

* 6.26 The operator overload for assignment (:=) is not implemented correctly.

* 6.26 Operator overloads from used and joined modules is not implemented.

* 6.26 Inherited operator overloads is not implemented or not tested (I don't
       actually recall which).

* 6.29 Exception handling on module destructor is not implemented.

* 6.35 Matrix math is not implemented.

* 6.36 Saturated math operators are not implemented.

* 6.37 Properties are not implemented.

* 6.39.2 Joined module overrides are do not work.

* 6.41 Classes and all operations with respect to classes are not implemented.

* The pgen module is in development, and does not work at present. The 
documentation covering it is a preview of how it is expected to work, and could
be changed by the time it is implemented.

* Linking external modules is in development, and further documentation on this
will be forthcoming.

* Debug mode has several issues. It needs work before it becomes useful.

That's it! Enjoy playing around with the system.
