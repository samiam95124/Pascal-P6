******************************* NEWS FOR 2024-09-12 ****************************

Welcome to the v0.3 release!

This is the third beta release of Pascal-P6. The v0.3 release is the first
completely stand-alone release of Pascal-P6. This is due to the new program, 
pgen, which generates a 64 bit x86 (AMD64) machine code runnable version
of Pascal-P6.

What has been done since the v0.2 release:

* pgen brought up.

* Pascal-P6 was recompiled with pgen, now self-hosted.

* User manual extensively updated.

* Improvements to debug mode.

Pascaline features not implemented in Pascal-P6 v0.3:

* 64 bit Linux is the only supported version. At this time, only 64 bit Linux is
tested and supported.

That's it! Enjoy playing around with the system.
