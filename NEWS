******************************* NEWS FOR 2023-05-11 ****************************

Welcome to the v0.2 release!

This is the second beta release of Pascal-P6. I wanted to get a release in 
before taking on the pgen module again, which I expect to take a minimum of a
month or two.

A lot has been done since the v0.1 release:

* The debugger has been dramatically improved. There are no outstanding bugs,
  although there is a functional issue (next).

* Overloads work from uses/joins modules. The only remaining issue is the
  debugger does not know how to deal with them.

* The debugger has a regression test.

* Options to pcom and pint can now be passed on the command line.

* Pulldown marks are implemented. This was a huge amount of work.

Pascaline features not implemented in Pascal-P6 v0.2:

* 6.16 Constant strings on read/ln is not implemented (specifying text to skip).

* 6.16.1 Radix convertion on input.

* 6.16.2 Radix specifiers in read/ln statements.

* 6.26 The operator overload for assignment (:=) is not implemented correctly.

* 6.26 Inherited operator overloads is not implemented or not tested (I don't
       actually recall which).

* 6.29 Exception handling on module destructor is not implemented.

* 6.35 Matrix math is not implemented.

* 6.36 Saturated math operators are not implemented.

* 6.37 Properties are not implemented.

* 6.41 Classes and all operations with respect to classes are not implemented.

* The pgen module is in development, and does not work at present. The 
documentation covering it is a preview of how it is expected to work, and could
be changed by the time it is implemented.

* 64 bit Linux is the only supported version. At this time, only 64 bit Linux is
tested and supported.

That's it! Enjoy playing around with the system.
