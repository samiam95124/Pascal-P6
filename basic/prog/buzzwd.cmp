THIS COMPUTER DEMONSTRATION IS A NEW AID FOR
PREPARING SPEECHES AND BRIEFINGS.  IT'S A BUZZWORD
GENERATOR WHICH PROVIDES YOU WITH A SET OF 3 HIGHLY
ACCEPTABLE WORDS TO WORK INTO YOUR MATERIAL.  THE WORDS
DON'T ACTUALLY MEAN ANYTHING, BUT THEY SOUND GREAT.

THE PROCEDURE:
     THINK OF ANY THREE NUMBERS BETWEEN 0 AND 9.  ENTER
     THEM AFTER THE '?' SEPARATED BY COMMAS.   YOUR
     BUZZWORD WILL BE PRINTED OUT.  TYPING '100' FOR
     EACH OF YOUR CHOICES STOPS THIS PROGRAM.
WHAT ARE YOUR THREE NUMBERS? 
 TOTAL MONITORED MOBILITY


THREE MORE NUMBERS? 
 RESPONSIVE INCREMENTAL OPTIONS


THREE MORE NUMBERS? 
 INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT OPTIONS


THREE MORE NUMBERS? 
 BALANCED POLICY CONTINGENCY


THREE MORE NUMBERS? GOODBYE FOR NOW!
