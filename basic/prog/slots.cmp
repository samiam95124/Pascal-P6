ONE ARM BANDIT

EACH PLAY YOU CAN PUT ANY AMOUNT OF SILVER DOLLARS INTO
THE MACHINE, UP TO THE BALANCE YOU HAVE, BY TYPING IN
THE QUANTITY OF DOLLARS.

YOU 'PULL DOWN THE HANDLE' BY DEPRESSING THE 'RETURN' KEY.

WHEN YOUR BALANCE REACHES ZERO, THE GAME IS OVER.....
OR TYPE A ZERO ('0') TO QUIT AT ANY TIME.


YOU ARE GIVEN $50 TO PLAY WITH, GOOD LUCK.

HOW MANY DOLLARS DO YOU WANT TO PUT IN ON YOUR FIRST PLAY?
