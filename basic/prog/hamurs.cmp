YOU ARE THE RULER OF THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF SUMERIA.
YOUR PEOPLE CALL YOU 'HAMURABI THE WISE'. YOUR TASK IS
TO DEVELOP A STABLE ECONOMY BY THE WISE MANAGEMENT OF
YOUR RESOURCES. YOU WILL BE BESET FROM TIME TO TIME
BY NATURAL EVENTS. THE ONLY HELP I CAN GIVE YOU IS THE 
FACT THAT IT TAKES 2 BUSHELS OF GRAIN AS SEED TO PLANT
AN ACRE. MAY YOU JUDGE WELL, ALKNOWING HAMURABI.
