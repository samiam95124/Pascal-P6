 RANDOM POETRY IN FOUR PART HARMONY.



THE HOURS RISE UP PUTTING OFF STARS
    AND IT IS DAWN
ON EARTH A CANDLE IS EXTINGUISED
    THE CITY WAKES

NOBODY LOSES ALL THE TIME 
HIS MOST WISE MUSIC STOLE
    NOTHING FROM DEATH
  AND IT IS DAY

OR WITH THY MIND AGAINST MY MIND,
    YOU SHOULD NOT HEAR ME SPEAK
SHE SLEEPS WITH DEATH UPON HER MOUTH
    AND A SONG IN HER EYES
AND SPACE IS MISING FOR IT WAS 
STOLEN FOR ALL TIME TO COME 
WITH A SONG UPON HER MOUTH
    HAVING DEATH IN HER EYES
WITH A SONG UPON HER MOUTH
    HAVING DEATH IN HER EYES
 THE HOURS DESENDED
                   PUTTING ON STARS
WHO SPOKE THIS EARTH SO GLAD AND BIG
    EVEN A THING ALL SMALL AND SAD
THERE IS NEVER AN END,
 MERELY A BELATED BEGINING...


                      BY  A. COM PUTER.
