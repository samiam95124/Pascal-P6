WHO ALWAYS DROVE IT QUICKLY. THERE IS A SMELLY DOG IN
THE BACK SEAT. IT HAS A CHROME CAT ON THE HOOD, A BRIGHT

BANANA IN ITS MOUTH. A SHINY REWARD IS OFFERED.

                 AN ADULT WESTERN

TEX SMITH, THE MARSHALL OF FRED CITY RODE INTO TOWN. HE
SAT SLOWLY IN THE SADDLE, READY FOR TROUBLE. HE KNEW THAT
HIS FUNNY ENEMY, GEORGE THE KID WAS IN TOWN. THE KID WAS
IN LOVE WITH TEX'S HORSE, ALICE.  SUDDENLY THE KID CAME OUT
OF THE TINY NUGGET SALOON.

'DRAW TEX,' HE YELLED LOUDLY.

TEX REACHED FOR HIS TREE, BUT BEFORE HE COULD GET IT
OUT OF HIS BANANA THE KID FIRED, HITTING TEX IN THE COMPUTER
AND THE SHOE.

AS TEX FELL HE PULLED OUT HIS OWN MOON AND SHOT THE KID
 3 TIMES IN THE CHEESE. THE KID DROPPED IN A POOL
OF LEMONADE.

'ZOUNDS,' TEX SAID, 'I HATED TO DO IT BUT
HE WAS ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE DRAGON.'


IF YOU PLAN ON JOINING THE ARMY, HERE ARE SOME SHINY
HINTS THAT WILL HELP YOU BECOME A WILD SOLDIER.

THE ARMY IS MADE UP OF OFFICERS, NON-COMS AND DOGS.

SHINED, AND SEE THAT YOUR COMPUTER IS CLEAN AT ALL TIMES,
YOU WILL BE A CREDIT TO THE SLOGAN:

            THE ARMY BUILDS BETTER SHOES!

AT ROLL CALL, WHEN THE OLD SERGEANT CALLS YOUR NAME,
SHOUT 'ZOUNDS' LOUD AND CLEAR.

YOU WILL BECOME FAMILIAR WITH WEAPONS LIKE THE .30 CALIBRE

BUST-A-BUTTON AND DUCK DEPT. STORE
DIX HILLS, NEW YORK

DEAR SIRS:

LAST WEEK I PURCHASED A TALL CONTOUR WATER BED IN YOUR
STORE. I GOT IT ESPECIALLY FOR MY SMELLY HUSBAND WHO SLEEPS
VERY QUICKLY AND SAYS THAT LARGE WATER BEDS THAT HAVE
DOGS IN THEM MAKE HIS HOUSE ACHE. WHEN THE BED
ARRIVED MY HUSBAND TESTED IT SLOWLY AND SAID THE OLD
BANANA WAS BENT AND KEPT PRESSING INTO HIS COMPUTER. HE SAYS
THIS COULD LEAD TO A WILD CONDITION OF THE MOON.

I WOULD LIKE TO EXCHANGE THIS PURPLE BED FOR ONE THAT
WILL ALLOW MY HUSBAND TO SLEEP SOFTLY AND WON'T MAKE
HIS DRAGON SORE.

                             YOURS GENTLY,
                             ALICE SMITH


DO YOU WANT ANOTHER STORY
? 
O.K.  SEE YOU AGAIN SOMETIME!
