TANK GAME

******************************************************************************

You are playing against several tanks on a field. "*" marks the edges of the
field, "+" mark enemy tanks, "@" marks your position, and "#" mark the
position of tank traps. You can move in any direction on your turn, including
the diagonals. After you move, each of the enemy tanks will also move, in your
direction. If they hit you, you lose. If they hit a tank trap, they are out
of the game. If all the enemy tanks die in this fashion, you win the game.
