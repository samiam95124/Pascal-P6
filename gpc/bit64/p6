# Compile and run with P6 using GPC
#
# Execute with:
#
# p6 [flags] [<sourcefile>]...
#
# Where <sourcefile> is the name of the source file without
# extention. The Pascal input file(s) are compiled and run
# as a group. Any compiler errors are output to the screen.
# Input and output to and from the running program are from
# and to the console.
#
# The flags are one of:
#
# --pmach	  Generate mach code and run the result through pmach.
# --cmach	  Generate mach code and run the result through cmach.
# --package   Generate a packaged application and run.
#
# The intermediate code is placed in <file>.p6, where the <file> is the last
# filename on the command line, which is considered the name of the program.
# If a binary intermediate is selected (pmach, cmach or package mode), then the
# intel hex format binary form of the P-machine code will be placed in
# <file>.p6o, where <file> is the program name. For package mode, the final
# executable will be placed under the program name.
