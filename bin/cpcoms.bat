rem First, change elide patterns to remove prr file statements.
rem The modified file goes in pcomm.pas (pcom modified).
rem
sed -e 's/{elide}/{/g' -e 's/{noelide}/}/g' source\pcom.pas > pcomm.pas

rem Compile pcom to intermediate code using its binary version.
rem
echo Compiling pcom to intermediate code
call compile pcomm
type pcomm.err

rem Now run that code on the interpreter and have it compile itself
rem to intermediate again.

echo Running pcom to compile itself
cat pcomm.p5 pcomm.pas > tmp.p5
mv pcomm.p5 pcomm.p5.org
cp tmp.p5 pcomm.p5

call run pcomm

rem Now we have the original intermediate from the binary version
rem of pcom, and the intermediate generated by the interpreted
rem pcom. Compare them for equality. Put the result in pcomm.dif.

call diffnole pcomm.p5.org pcomm.out > pcomm.dif
