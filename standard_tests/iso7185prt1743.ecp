Pascal-P6 complies with the requirements of Pascaline version 0.4
and the following annexes: A,B,C,E.


{ 
 
PRT test 1743: An expression denotes a value unless a variable denoted by a 
               variable-access contained by the expression is undefined at the 
               time of its use, in which case that use is an error. 
 
               ISO 7185 reference: 6.7.1 
 
} 
 
program iso7185prt1743(output); 
 
var a: integer; 
 
begin 
 
   { In this case the undefined variable is output to force the error, if it can 
     be done. Not many compilers check for undefines. } 
   write(a) 
 
end.
