P6 Pascal compiler vs. 0.2.x
Pascal-P6 complies with the requirements of Pascaline version 0.4
and the following annexes: A,B,C,E.


{ 
 
PRT test 1736: For round(x), if x is positive or zero then round(x) is 
               equivalent to trunc(x+0.5), otherwise round(x) is equivalent to 
               trunc(x- 0.5). It is an error if such a value does not exist.
