PRT test 1702: It is an error unless a variant is active for the entirety of 
               each reference and access to each component of the variant. 
 
               ISO 7185 reference: 6.5.3.3 
 
               There are four possible cases for active variants: 
 
                  A: Reference to discriminated variant. 
                  B: Change to the tagfield of a discriminated variant with 
                     an outstanding reference. 
                  C: Read of an undiscriminated variant after a write. 
                  D: Write of an undiscriminated variant with outstanding 
                     reference. 
 
               This is case A, discrminated variant with standard reference.
