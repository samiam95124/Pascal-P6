P6 Pascal compiler vs. 0.4.x
Pascal-P6 complies with the requirements of Pascaline version 0.4
and the following annexes: A,B,C,E.


{ 
 
PRT test 1917: Redefinition of same constant. 
 
    Defining a constant as itself is both a reference and a defining point, thus 
    it is inherently illegal. 
 
} 
 
program iso7185prt1917(output); 
 
const one = 1; 
 
procedure x; 
 
const one = one; 
    16   ****                  ^242
    16   ****  242 Identifier referenced before defining point
 
begin 
 
   write(one) 
    
end; 
one        unreferenced

 
begin 
 
   writeln('Value is: ', one) 
    
end.
