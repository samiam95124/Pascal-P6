Pascal-P6 complies with the requirements of Pascaline version 0.4
and the following annexes: A,B,C,E.

    12       -8                   B: Change to the tagfield of a discriminated variant with 
    13       -8                      an outstanding reference. 
    14       -8                   C: Read of an undiscriminated variant after a write. 
    15       -8                   D: Write of an undiscriminated variant with outstanding 
    16       -8                      reference.
