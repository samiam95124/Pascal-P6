                         THE PASCAL-P6 COMPILER/INTERPRETER

============================== Description =====================================

This is the 6th version of the Pascal-P compiler from Zurich. Pascal-P6 is the
Pascal-P5 compiler upgraded to include the set of extensions defined by the
Pascaline language standard.

Pascal-P was an implementation kit, created between 1972 and 1974, for the
original language Pascal. The source for the original compiler was passed around
and modified quite a bit, but Niklaus Wirth noted that it was very popular, and
represented a good method to popularize the language. He gathered the source
into a clean version called Pascal-P2, which was the basis of UCSD Pascal, which
in turn was the base language for Borland Pascal. The Zurich group then created
an improved version called Pascal-P4. From there a fully ISO 7185 standard
version was created as Pascal-P5. Pascal-P6 is Pascal-P5 extended to accept the
Pascaline language, a highly extended version of ISO 7185 Pascal. It also 
can generate AMD64 binaries in addition to being an interpreter.

The full instructions for running and setting up the Pascal-P6 compiler/interpreter
have all been incorporated into the document:

doc/the_p6_compiler.docx

Which is a Microsoft Word document, 2007 or later.

Please consult this documents for full instructions on how to use Pascal-P6.

============================== Quick start =====================================

Please note that to set up all features of the system, you need to clone
submodules as well:

git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/samiam95124/Pascal-P6.git

If you already cloned the repo without submodules, don't worry. Just execute:

git submodule update --init --recursive

And you will get the submodules.

Pascal-p6 uses the standard GNU release layout. You execute:

[linux]

> . ./setpath
> ./configure
> make

(You can avoid "setpath" by placing the ./bin directory on your path)

This will make the compiler and interpreter set. You can then try a sample
program as:

> p6 sample_programs/hello

================================== Problems ====================================

The present  version of Pascal-P6 is limited to Linux, and has been run
extensively on Ubuntu. The Windows and Mac OS/X versions are not runnable at
this time.

You need the "flip" line ending adapation program. If you don't have it, we
include a copy you can compile, or you can simply go find it. It is a widely
available program. You can install it on your Linux via:

sudo apt install flip

Because if what you have to say is general to Pascal-P6, everyone can see it
there. There are also several subcatagories for messages at:
